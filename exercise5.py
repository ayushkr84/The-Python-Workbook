 # In many jurisdictions a small depositis added to drink containers to encourage people
 # to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or
 # less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding more than one liter have a
 # $0.25 deposit.
 # Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size from the user.
 # Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be
 # received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar
 # sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.
